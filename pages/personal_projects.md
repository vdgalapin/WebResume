					<p>
						This coffee website is something me and my partner made just to share our experiences from the coffee shops we’ve been to — both around the Philippines and in other countries we’ve visited. We don’t do ratings or anything like that. We just write what we feel and what stood out to us. Could be the vibe, the coffee itself, how the staff treated us, or even just something random that made the place memorable.
						<br/>
						It’s kind of like a personal coffee journal. I built it using Jekyll and hosted it on GitHub Pages so it’s easy to update. I used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap to keep it clean and simple. Nothing too fancy — just something that works and shows what we liked about each place.
