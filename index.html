                        The first thing I remember about the town where I was born is St. Michael’s Cathedral in Iligan City. I grew up in a religious household, and going to church was a regular part of our life. But what really made it special for me as a kid was what came after mass — my grandparents would always buy me orange munchkins (donut holes, as they’re called in the US) from Dunkin' Donuts. I was a kid who loved food a little too much, so I’d always look forward to Sundays and Wednesdays, not just for church, but for those sweet little treats waiting for me afterward.
                        <br/>
                        Eventually, my family moved to Cagayan de Oro — a much bigger city compared to Iligan — because my dad got a new job. I was in 4th grade when we moved, and I stayed there until 8th grade. It was in CDO where I found myself representing our school in chess. I was one of the top players back then, and it’s something I was really proud of. But as much as I loved the game, I knew it wasn’t something that could help me get a scholarship to a private high school — so I had to let that dream go.

                    <h1>Maryville High School</h1>
                    <p >Maryville High School has one of the weirdest mascot stories I’ve ever heard. We were called the Spoofhounds. The name came from our old football coach back in the 80s. At the time, our football team was on a losing streak, and out of frustration, the coach called the players “lazy hounds.” Somehow, that nickname stuck — and that’s how we ended up being called the Spoofhounds. To this day, I still don’t really understand why or how it became our official mascot, but it definitely made us unique.
                    <br/>
                    Throughout my high school life, I did my best to adjust and get along with the new culture and people around me. Coming from the Philippines, moving to an American high school was such a big change. Like many other foreign students, I wanted to be part of that so-called American dream. I took my classes seriously, got involved in clubs and sports, and tried to make the most out of my experience. Eventually, I graduated with honors and received multiple scholarships — proof that all the hard work and effort paid off.</p>

                        <p>One of the best things about working at Taco Bell was getting to keep the food whenever I made a mistake — like if someone ordered a soft taco without cheese, and I had already put cheese on it. I didn’t mind though. More food for me.
                        <br/>
                        I was a machine on the line. I could knock out 12 hard shell tacos in under two minutes — meat, lettuce, and cheddar cheese all perfectly assembled. But out of everything on the menu, my all-time favorite was the steak quesarito. Unfortunately, they discontinued it shortly after I quit — almost like it left with me</p>

                            I didn’t get a lot of hours working at Taco Bell, especially during the summer. A lot of high school kids were also fighting for hours — and I was one of them. So, I decided to apply for a custodial job at a Catholic church during the summer.
                            <br/>
                            I actually liked working there. They let me play music while I worked, and I could take my lunch break whenever I wanted. I learned to manage my time well because there were always events and activities happening at the church. I had to make sure everything was cleaned and ready before the students and teachers arrived.
                            <br/>
                            I guess I did a good job because they ended up hiring me to clean the school after school hours as a part-time gig too.

                <p> I worked as a machine operator for three years while I was in college. I’d go to school at 7 a.m., then head to work from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. It was a hectic schedule, but that job helped me a lot—both financially and in building my skills. I developed a lot of soft skills like leadership, communication, efficiency, and accountability.

                    While I was working in Kawasaki and taking computer science classes, I got the opportunity to work as an intern. It didn’t pay as much as being a machine operator, but the flexible hours made it possible for me to do both. That was probably one of the busiest years I’ve ever had—it really took a lot out of me. I had to stay on top of my schedule every single day while making sure I completed all my tasks.

                            The Warehouse Management System is a robust web and mobile application developed to manage and streamline end-to-end warehouse operations. The system features comprehensive modules including cycle counting, location verification, wave generation, stock movement, receiving, order picking, and dispatching. Designed for real-time accuracy and operational efficiency, it empowers warehouse staff to execute tasks on the floor using mobile devices—ensuring seamless coordination and faster turnaround times.

                            One of the key features of the system is its external notification integration, which connects with third-party applications to send alerts and updates to users even when they are offsite or outside working hours. This ensures critical actions—such as urgent stock movements, completed waves, or cycle count discrepancies—are addressed promptly regardless of user location. The system also supports online and offline modes to guarantee uninterrupted functionality across the plant.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> The WMS was built using LANSA for cross-platform development, supporting both web and mobile interfaces. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for enhanced interactivity. XML and XSL were used for data formatting and UI presentation. The backend relied on SQL to manage inventory data, transaction logs, and location tracking. For external communication, the system was integrated with third-party notification services via server-side triggers, enabling offsite alerting and continuous operational awareness.gi</p>
